The Chaotic Harmony Hypothesis explores a revolutionary idea: that black holes serve as cosmic recyclers, transforming matter into quantum vibrational blueprints—the "DNA" of the universe. These blueprints are redistributed as Hawking radiation, influencing galaxy formation and cosmic structure. The hypothesis introduces the concept of vibrational encoding, where electrons store and transport quantum information. It proposes negative space as a shared reservoir, acting as a bridge between black holes and the Big Bang, driving the cycle of cosmic creation and destruction.

This interdisciplinary theory ties together quantum mechanics, cosmology, and thermodynamics, presenting testable predictions for observing structured patterns in Hawking radiation, dark matter, and entropy transitions. By refining this framework, the hypothesis offers a bold new perspective on the universe’s interconnected nature.
